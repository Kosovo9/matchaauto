# Dev Activity Report: Jan 6-7, 2026

**Senior Engineer Audit of Match-Auto Trinity Repository**

## 📊 Summary of Activity
In the last 48 hours, the project transitioned from a purely visual "skeleton" to a functional "motorized" architecture. The focus was on **Dynamic Theming**, **Hybrid AI Integration**, and **Core Wiring**.

### 🛠️ Key Accomplishments
- **Dynamic Trinity Theming:** (Jan 7) Refactored the `QuantumHero` component to support three distinct modes (Cyber-Blue for Auto, Luxury-Gold for Assets, Matcha-Green for Marketplace).
- **Hybrid AI Engine:** (Jan 8 early) Integrated Hugging Face (Qwen/DeepSeek) and Ollama for embeddings and semantic search.
- **RAG Implementation:** Enabled `pgvector` and created the `rag.service.ts` to power semantinc searches across the three domains.
- **Unified Schema:** (Jan 7 night) Created the `trinity-schema.sql` to consolidate listings, geodata, and embeddings in a single source of truth.
- **Feature Flagging:** Implemented `FeatureFlag` component and `useFeature` hook for modular rollout.

### 🔍 Risk & Technical Debt
- **External Dependency Timeouts:** Nominatim (Maps) and Ollama (AI) were identified as core bottlenecks causing test failures. (Fixed with mocking in local/test).
- **Wiring Gaps:** Several backend controllers (Radius Search, Route Optimization) were created but are mostly returning mock data or are not yet linked to the UI.
- **Zod Record Issues:** Refactored multiple service files to use strict typing in Zod schemas.
